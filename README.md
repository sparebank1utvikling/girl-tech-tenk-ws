# Getting Started with this app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The react online editors we've tried has good support for react/js files, but limited options for styling imports.

Therefore, is project is set up to help:
1. Give the developers a working dev environment to create example code for a workshop
2. Generate a css-file with all necessary styling from ffe

Because of this, and to make sure no styling code is forgotten, the styling-part of the project is a little different.

When first cloning this app `npm install` in root folder.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`
